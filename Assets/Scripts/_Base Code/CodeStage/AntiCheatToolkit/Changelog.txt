    original PlayerPrefs data will be deleted

  after migration).

    (will be removed in future)
  * new flexible lock data to device feature introduced, read more in api docs and readme
  * now saved data may be recovered in emergency cases (like device ID change after updating from iOS 6 to iOS 7)

  * key is now encrypted with common encryptionKey (previously default key for ObscuredString was used)
  * accessing data saved with regular PlayerPrefs now generates warning with additional information
